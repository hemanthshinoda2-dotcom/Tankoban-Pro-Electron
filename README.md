## Windows setup

1. Run `install_and_run.bat` to install dependencies and launch the app.
2. Run `build_windows_exe.bat` to build distributables.

Both scripts automatically download MPV runtime files into `app/resources/mpv/windows` when missing.

## Release gate

Before publishing any release, run the objective pass/fail checklist in `RELEASE_CHECKLIST.md`.
